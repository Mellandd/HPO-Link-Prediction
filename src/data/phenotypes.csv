Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma.

Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions. These two proteins are detectable in the bloodstream and an elevated level may reflect idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."" [PMID:28591049]"

Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS.

HP:0033849,"""The term bilingual aphasia is used to refer to aphasia in persons who speak two or more languages. When a multilingual speaker has aphasia following a stroke, the languages spoken premorbidly may show comparable or differential patterns of impairment. Differential patterns may manifest as greater impairment in one language compared to another, or as differences in the characteristics of aphasia. Clinical reports of bilingual aphasia show dissociations in the processing of the language learned first (L1) and and second (L2), with one language more impaired than the other. Other cases show a pattern of differential recovery where L2 is recovered only after L1. Another pattern is alternating antagonism; i.e., patients access one language in spontaneous speech and inhibit the other language for alternating periods. This term should be used for a type of aphasia in a person who speaks multiple languages in which the impairment is different for different languages."" [PMID:31024369]"

It is often focal, but may be multifocal, bilateral or generalized, as a consequence of intracortical and transcallosal spreading of abnormal activity. It typically occurs on voluntary action and may affect speech and gait. Cortical myoclonic jerks are stimulus sensitive, typically to touch, but sensitivity to visual stimuli is also described. Most patients with cortical myoclonus have both positive myoclonus and NM, occurring either independently or together as a complex of the two kinds of myoclonus. If cortical myoclonus is prolonged and lasts for hours, days or weeks, it is called epilepsia partials continua and is considered to be a rare form of focal epileptic status. Focal cortical myoclonus almost always points to an underlining lesion of the sensori-motor cortex, which produces hyperexcitability (e.g. vascular, inflammatory or neoplastic)."" [PMID:21339907]"
